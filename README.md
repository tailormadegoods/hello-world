Learning the ropes ~~~~
I came on here about 2 weeks after learning about GitHub from a dad named Tim from my oldest son's school.  We went camping two weeks ago and got to talking about our work.  Funny that we only now, the end of the school year, had a chance to meet and actually connect.  Either way, I'm glad I met him.  Now I can test some ideas I've had and learn a new language.  So far the new terms like master and branch are very interesting and I like the way it works.
